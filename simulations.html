														Paddled wheels in partially immersed configurations are one of the
														most common propulsion devices for small and/or low speed amphibious
														vehicles. The wake features of this wheels significantly impact
														their performance. Higher RPM leads to higher propulsive forces,
														however, for certain flow regimes, the rate of increment shows a
														drastic drop and increasing RPM may not be advantegeous.

														The case is solved by assuming the wheel constructed of closely placed
														particles with immersed boundary conditions. From experiments, it is
														known after certain ratio (V*) of wheel tip to the water flow velocity,
														a minor increase in lift force requires significant increase in wheel
														speed. It is noticed that this happens after occurrence of a splash
														called Bow Splash ahead of wheel. Experiments show (figure below)
														that the bow splash occurs when a nondimensional number called
														Froude number (Fr) is greater than 0.85 and the V* less than
														0.43. This study is aimed at simulating wakes of multiple cases around
														the transition region to bow splash using NGA2.

														Currently, high thrust rocket engines use pressure driven injectors
														due to degree of atomization required in combustion chamber. High 
														thrust engines require very high chamber pressures upto the range of
														250 bars. This leads to having pumping
														pressures of as high as ≈800 bars, which makes the plumbing systems
														extremely complicated. The pressure driven injectors utilize pressure
														energy to atomize, whereas, here, a system is proposed which uses
														rotational kinetic energy to produce turbulence. The advantage of
														such a system is that it is easier to produce very high rotational
														speeds than handling ultra-high pressures across the system.

														Conventional rotary atomizers in the sense that they rotate at very
														high speeds fluid undergo Rayleigh-Taylor instability in radial
														direction, and leaving a jet of fluid in radial direction. These
														jets undergo Rayleigh-Plateau instability to result in droplet
														breakup and result in atomized fluid. Here, it is proposed to induce
														significant turbulence before the fluid streak is formed due to
														Rayleigh-Taylor instability, thereby causing better atomization at
														much lower rotational speeds. This study is aimed at simulating
														Rayleigh-Taylor instability with inherent turbulence and thereby
														studying the performance of such atomizers.
														<br>
														The video above shows the Rayleigh-Taylor atomizer simulated for
														a particular set of inputs. The rotational velocity is not enough
														to creat Rayleigh-Plateau instability. Following are the experimental
														observations of different ratios of rotational speeds to flow rate.

														This project was developed to demonstrate the real engine operation.
														The numbers used here are inspired by General Electric GE4 single-spool
														turbojet engine which was designed in late 1960s to power Boeing 2707
														supersonic transport. The engine had afterburning capabilities and
														produced thrust of 220 kN (50,000 lbf) without afterburner and 290 kN
														(65,000 lbf). This project is a thermodynamic analysis based on 
														aerothermodynamically generated turbomachinery maps. The results are
														of the similar order as GE4, but not exactly same as we do not have
														compressor and turbine maps generated through rig testing. The maps
														used here are generated using Blade Element Theory, which is an
														analytical approximation of compressor performance.

														The study was done to gauge capabilities of NGA2 in handling

														distributed particles throughout the space was obtained. Gravity

														For shaking, gravity flipping model is adopted. The gravity is inverted to +Y
														for time equal to value of parameter flipTime. The gravity is in +Y direction
														from t = 0 s, to t = flipTime. The gravity is flipped back to -Y direction at
														t = flipTime, and the duration is set such that the net displacement of particles
														is 0. However, the velocity of particle at the end of &Deltat is not 0.
														Thus, by the time particles are near the bottom wall, the particles have a velocity,
														which makes them bounce on the wall hard. This sets particles to motion in 
														+Y despite gravity being -Y.
														In the simulation, time to flip gravity from +Y to -Y is set to 3xflipTime, so
														that particles have flipTime time to levitate while gravity pointing downwards,
														thus creating real scenario which cause granular convection. The plots for mean
														y position of both types of particles is shown in figure below.

														there is large grouping of small particles on the top, while in rest of the 
														locations small particles exist in smaller groups. The reasoning behind large 
														grouping on top is assumed that small particles being lighter, are propelled much 
														higher compared to large particles after impact on the lower wall, and when the 
														flipping is turned off, all the levitating small particles settle later than 
														large particles, thereby forming a large group on the top. This indicates that 
														horizontal shaking of the particles might be a better choice, however NGA2 
														requires significant functionality addition to be able to that.

														Ofparticular interest is the relation between the lengthscale over which the layer  is initially 
														perturbed, and the corresponding growth rate of the instability.

													The comparison of growth rate prediction of NGA2 and the theoretical prediction
													is shown below.
													<div class="image fit">
														<img src="images/simulations/ngrplot.png" />
													</div>
													As can be seen, the growth rate is matching very closely to the inviscid exact equation.
													However, the deviation can be seen towards the lower k (which corresponds to higher 
													domain size in x-direction). Since the number of elements are kept same in x-direction,
													the elements are skewed for lower wavenumbers, which might be the source of deviation 
													since NGA2 gives best result for such simulations when the cels are almost cubic.

														A nonlinear dynamic analysis is conducted on a hydraulic valve. The
														valve being analyzed is shown in the figure below.
													</p>
													<div class="image fit">
														<img src="images/simulations/valve.JPG" />
													</div>
													<p>
														Valve is governed by the 3rd order nonlinear ordinary differential equation.
														Valve position (X) normalized by maximum valve opening distance is used as the 
														independent variable. Depending on the initial set position of the valve,
														the response of valve varied. It was observed, that for all X < 2, the response
														was stable, as shown the next figure. The figure after that represent the
														phase portrait of the system.

													<p>
														For X > 2, the response was oscillating motion of the valve piston,
														and the phase portrait was converging to a limit cycle, as can be seen
														in next two figures.

														Next, a factor of leak in the valve is introduced, and the system responds

														The algorithm written includes Roulette Wheel Selection for crossover and Muhlenbein's
														Method for mutation. The optimum values of parameters were obtained by observing trend
														of convergence. Elitisim was later added and convergence time reduce to about 1/8th.
